_As part of my work as an **Engineer of Studies at the Centre de RÃ©alitÃ© Ã‰tendue XR2C2**, I have participated in numerous research tasks and supported artistic residencies. In this residency, I was responsible for the full technical deployment of **motion capture with Rokoko**, **sound design**, and the **development and deployment of the AR app** used in the immersive theater piece seen in the video._
